It's been one week and one day I've been here at Coding House.  It's really, really, really
freaking awesome!  I absolutely love it here, the amount that I've learned in the past week 
here is just amazing, it competes with the amount I learned going to Highschool.  Yesterday
and the day before I learned how to store data on peoples computers when they visit my websites
which means that Web Apps I build from now on will have persistent data.  That means you can
visit my Todo-List, add in new items cross them off or remove them, and they will stay stored
so that you can see them again the next time you visit.  This is an absolutely great feature 
that I can implement into pretty much anything I write from now on, it's the first step towards
databases and persistent data, which also is the first step to building fully functional apps.

I'm going to throw in a link to the site I created for the Contact List I built yesterday using
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Font-Awesome.  I love the amount of librarys
I've learned to use as well, there's so many things out there that you can load in on top
of your basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to really give your websites some amazing and crazy
functionality.  Well, I've gotta get back to filling my head with code and learning VIM, and 
the whole VIM thing is another story completely for another day.  If you've ever used VIM as
a text editor you'll know exactly what I mean by that!  Anyways, thank you guys for the read
and if your following my Blog, thats awesome!  Expect some major interface changes in the next
week for this blog, I'm going to make it pretty don't worry, at the moment it's a little bit
of an eye-sore but just bear with me here.  Thank you guys so much again for everything, and 
have an amazing day!!!
