Let's start this post off like this: CodingHouse is the most intense learning experience I've ever encountered in my life and we have only scraped the surface.  We are learning so much every day, a ridiculous amount.

With that being said, I absolutely positively love it here, I've been working pretty much ALL DAY EVERY DAY for these first 3 days of curriculum.  Yeah, it is tiring. Yeah, it is hard.  Yeah, theres only about two hours of breaks a day until approximately two in the morning.  But I seriously love it.  The vast amount of knowledge that is housed in this BootCamp is incredible, being around these instructors who are some of the smartest people I have ever met is wonderful.  I cannot wait to see what amazing things come out of this class, I'm going to link a couple of things that I've built in these first three days so everyone can check them out!

Thanks for the read and the visit guys, anyone who wants to follow what I'm doing here can expect at least 1-3 of these posts per week!  Thanks so much again!

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
