    <description>This is going to be my blog for the next while! I&#39;m pretty excited to start it up and I will be explaining my current feats with programming and supply you all with some links to go and check out my current projects!
I&#39;ll also be posting code snippets and other things like: technical issues  that I run into and just general information about my current life!

        <title>Getting Better at Coding House!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been one week and one day I’ve been here at Coding House.  It’s really, really, really
freaking awesome!  I absolutely love it here, the amount that I’ve learned in the past week 
here is just amazing, it competes with the amount I learned going to Highschool.  Yesterday
and the day before I learned how to store data on peoples computers when they visit my websites
which means that Web Apps I build from now on will have persistent data.  That means you can
visit my Todo-List, add in new items cross them off or remove them, and they will stay stored
so that you can see them again the next time you visit.  This is an absolutely great feature 
that I can implement into pretty much anything I write from now on, it’s the first step towards
databases and persistent data, which also is the first step to building fully functional apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to throw in a link to the site I created for the Contact List I built yesterday using
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Font-Awesome.  I love the amount of librarys
I’ve learned to use as well, there’s so many things out there that you can load in on top
of your basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to really give your websites some amazing and crazy
functionality.  Well, I’ve gotta get back to filling my head with code and learning VIM, and 
the whole VIM thing is another story completely for another day.  If you’ve ever used VIM as
a text editor you’ll know exactly what I mean by that!  Anyways, thank you guys for the read
and if your following my Blog, thats awesome!  Expect some major interface changes in the next
week for this blog, I’m going to make it pretty don’t worry, at the moment it’s a little bit
of an eye-sore but just bear with me here.  Thank you guys so much again for everything, and 
have an amazing day!!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Started With Coding House.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start this post off like this: CodingHouse is the most intense learning experience I’ve ever encountered in my life and we have only scraped the surface.  We are learning so much every day, a ridiculous amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I absolutely positively love it here, I’ve been working pretty much ALL DAY EVERY DAY for these first 3 days of curriculum.  Yeah, it is tiring. Yeah, it is hard.  Yeah, theres only about two hours of breaks a day until approximately two in the morning.  But I seriously love it.  The vast amount of knowledge that is housed in this BootCamp is incredible, being around these instructors who are some of the smartest people I have ever met is wonderful.  I cannot wait to see what amazing things come out of this class, I’m going to link a couple of things that I’ve built in these first three days so everyone can check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the read and the visit guys, anyone who wants to follow what I’m doing here can expect at least 1-3 of these posts per week!  Thanks so much again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: --&gt;

&lt;!-- 
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
